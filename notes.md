**FOR TOMORROW**
- Create the ToDo list in the console first to ensure the logic is sound.
- LOG EVERYTHING TO CONSOLE AND THEN REPLACE THE LOGS WITH THE DOM MANIPULATION
- REMEMBER TO LOG ONLY PART OF THE OBJECT IF ITS RELEVANT
- You may need to prompt for user input but thats okay, write a class for it!
- I think I forgot how to request input in JavaScript lmao


**QUESTIONS**
- How will the Project get the tasks??????
- What does that pipeline look like???
